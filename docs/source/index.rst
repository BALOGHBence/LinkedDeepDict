.. include:: global_refs.rst

The `sigmaepsilon.deepdict`_ library is a lightweight Python package designed to simplify the management of 
nested dictionaries, providing intuitive and efficient handling of deeply nested structures. It extends the 
functionality of Python's built-in `dict` with features like automatic creation of nested levels, parent-child 
awareness, and enhanced navigation through attributes like `key`, `address`, and `parent`. The library supports 
array-like indexing and can visually represent nested data as trees when used with optional tools like `asciitree`. 
With a focus on maintainability and usability, `sigmaepsilon.deepdict`_ is particularly suited for dynamic and 
complex data structures in Python applications.
